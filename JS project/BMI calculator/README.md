### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Absolute and Relative Positioning
- Javascript
- DOM Manipulation

### What I learned

- how to apply Glass Effect 
- How to use DOM of javascript

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
